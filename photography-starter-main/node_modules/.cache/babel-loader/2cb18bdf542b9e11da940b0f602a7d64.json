Starting her career in fashion photography at the age of 18, it was on the sets of high end brand campaigns and fashion shows that Amelia learnt the technicalities of what has become her signature style. Having always been drawn to sociological documentary photography, Amelia applies her classic and energetic style seamlessly to her portraiture and documentary projects. Her first book Naked Britain published in 2017 by Kehrer Verlag, was created over two years, during which she visited numerous british nudist camps, photographing naturists and their community and immersing herself in this world by photographing the book while also naked herself. You can see some of these images here. This sparked her interest in exploring the female form and women's role in modern society which led on to being in an exhibition and book in The Houses of Parliament (209 Women) and photographing the official women's rights marches and campaigns during the centennial year (2018) that women won the right to vote in Britain. Amelia is currently working on a second book on this subject. She now hosts regular workshops and body positivity photography sessions photographing members of the public nude and in a raw and unretouched style to celebrate the diversity and variety of bodies that we don't always see in modern media. This started on International Women's Day and is now regularly held at Soho House, FORA and Agdon House.
